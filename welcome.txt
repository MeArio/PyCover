Thanks for installing PyCover!
Here's what you need to get started:

First, install `coverage`.
The easiest way to install it is

    pip install coverage

Next, give it a test!
Make sure you've run your tests with coverage on,
then press ctrl-alt-shift-c or
select "Toggle Uncovered Lines" from the Command Palette.
Run the same command again to hide the gutter marks.

If needed, update PyCover's settings.
(Preferences > Package Settings > PyCover > "Settings - User")

Available preferences are:
 
 * `python`: path to the Python interpreter the coverage report is read with.
   (If blank, PyCover attempts to find it for you.)

 * `onload`: whether PyCover should annotate lines when you load a file.
   (Defaults to false.)
